# Perfecting Horiseon Homepage 


## Description: 

This project was given to me to help a company set up their codebase so that it follows accessibility standards and making sure it can be optimized for search engines. 

When first looking at the code base I could see it was repetitive and disorganized. A lot of classes on the CSS page could be condensed. The first challenge was to make sure when these classes were condensed they still provided the same style. I had to do this step by step because I wanted to make sure each class worked. After that I made sure the lay out of both the HTML and CSS followed a concise structure.  This will help developers easily read the code. 

The second thing was to make sure HTML syntax tags were used so that it can make reading the code and layout of the website easier. This can help understand what content is suppose to go where. 

A challenge that I did come across was trying to create alt tags with title texts decriptive enough so that anyone who couldn't load images knew exactly what image was shown (not the process itself more what to describe.)

Overall I think this project was a sucess and I helped create a better website that fixed accessibility issues and left the code a lot cleaner than what it first was.
